# Mapping Wildlife Realities: A Data-Driven Approach to Animal Traits, Habitats, and Conservation Priorities

This project explores a curated dataset of animal traits, habitat distribution, and conservation statuses to generate actionable insights for biodiversity protection. Through exploratory data analysis and machine learning, we uncover patterns that inform proactive wildlife conservation strategies.

---

#### Dataset Overview

The **Animal Traits and Habitats** dataset contains detailed biological and ecological data on various animal species, including:

- **Animal Type** (e.g., Mammal, Bird, Reptile)
- **Speed** (in km/h)
- **Weight** (in kg)
- **Lifespan**
- **Continent** and **Country** of Habitat
- **Migration Status**
- **Reproduction Method**
- **Threat Level** (Conservation Risk)

---

#### Project Purpose

The primary goal is to identify species-specific and geographic trends that can:

- Highlight high-risk species and regions
- Analyze trait-driven survival patterns
- Support conservation decision-making
- Use machine learning to forecast threat levels

---

#### Problem Statement

Species extinction continues at an alarming rate due to habitat loss, climate change, and human interference. This project aims to bridge the data gap in conservation planning by analyzing key biological and ecological variables.

---

#### Key Questions Explored

- Do migratory species face greater extinction risk?
- How do speed and weight affect vulnerability?
- Can we predict the conservation status of animals based on traits?
- What insights can guide regional or global conservation strategies?

---

#### Key Achievements

- Developed **15 strategic objectives**, including:
  - 10 exploratory analyses with visuals
  - 5 machine learning use cases
- Generated **high-impact charts** with actionable insights
- Created **predictive models** to classify threat levels
- Identified biomechanical trends and conservation vulnerabilities

---

#### Technologies Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For analysis and visualization
- **GitHub**: Version control and documentation

---

#### Machine Learning Applications

1. Classification of Threat Level based on traits
2. Prediction of Migration status
3. Clustering species by ecological profiles
4. Feature importance ranking for threat factors
5. Risk scoring system for unknown species

---

#### Challenges

- Limited sample size
- Absence of detailed location or environmental variables
- Complexity in encoding categorical biological features

---

#### Opportunities

- Expand dataset with satellite, environmental, and climate data
- Deploy models into conservation agencies for real-time risk tracking
- Build interactive dashboards and educational tools

---

#### Future Work

- Integrate with **GIS-based habitat maps**
- Develop **real-time monitoring systems**
- Collaborate with **wildlife NGOs** and data providers
- Extend to endangered species tracking across time
